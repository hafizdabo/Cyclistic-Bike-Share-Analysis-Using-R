# Cyclistic-Ride-Share-Analysis
This is the final project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Capstone), where I am charged with the task of working for a fictional company, Cyclistic.


CASE STUDY: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

ABOUT THE COMPANY:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

THE PROJECT: 

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and the team, are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Lily Moreno, who is the director of marketing and my manager, has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

DATA SOURCE:
For the purpose of this project, I have obtained Cyclistic's historical trip data from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html (Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2, Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3, Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4, Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 

The project is done completely using R Programming, and knitted to html and pdf files. Kindly check the HTML or PDF files for the complete analysis and details of the steps taken. Thank you.
